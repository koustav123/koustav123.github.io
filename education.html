          <b>Topic</b>: Applications in Image Aesthetics Using Deep
            Learning: Attribute Prediction, Image Captioning
            and Score Regression <br>
          <b>Supervisor</b>: Prof. Aljosa Smolic <br>
          <b>Year :</b> February, 2021 <br><br>
                <p><b>Abstract :</b> Image Aesthetics refers to the branch of computer vision which is about the study
                    of
                    aesthetic properties of photographs <i>ie.</i> the factors which make an image look pleasing or
                    dull. Such
                    factors extend beyond the physical properties of an image such as object category or location to
                    subtler
                    and more nuanced ambiguous concepts such as ``candid expression'', ``harsh lighting'', ``bad
                    placement''
                    <i>etc.</i> Nevertheless, the problems in Image Aesthetics have traditionally been modelled as
                    classical
                    computer vision tasks such as classification, regression <i>etc.</i> And, as with most other
                    problems in
                    computer vision, deep learning based strategies have proved more effective in this area as well,
                    outperforming the classical approaches by a wide margin. Nowadays, automated systems for Image
                    Aesthetics Analysis have widespread applications from professional multimedia content development to
                    casual creatives in social media and advertising.

                <p> In this thesis, we study three different applications in Image Aesthetics using deep learning:
                    attribute
                    classification, feedback and score prediction.
            <p> First, we study the capacity of deep neural networks
                    in
                    capturing the geometric attributes <i>ie.</i> those which depend on the arrangement of objects
                    within the
                    image. Based on this, we propose a system that predicts the dominant aesthetic attributes in a
                    photograph such as The Rule of Thirds, leading lines <i>etc.</i>
            <p> Second, we develop an aesthetic
                    image
                    captioning framework by exploiting <i>in the wild</i> user feedback from the web. Given an image,
                    our
                    framework generates critical feedback such as ``<i>nice composition but the foreground is out of
                        focus</i>''.
            <p> Third, we investigate the limitations of traditional convolutional neural networks
                    with
                    respect to global relational reasoning and handling photographs of arbitrary aspect ratio and
                    resolution. We present a visual attention based graph neural network that addresses these
                    limitations
                    and advances the state-of-the-art in aesthetic score prediction.</p>

          <b>Topic</b>: A Sketch-based Approach for Multimedia Retrieval <br>
          <b>Supervisor</b>: Prof. Anoop Namboodiri <br>
          <b>Year :</b> 2016 <br><br>
                            <p><b>Abstract :</b> A hand-drawn sketch is a convenient way to search for an image or a video from a
                    database where examples are unavailable or textual queries are too difficult to articulate. In this
                    thesis, we have tried to propose solutions for some problems in sketch-based multimedia retrieval.
                    In
                    case of image search, the queries could be approximate binary outlines of the actual objects. In
                    case of
                    videos, we consider the case where the user can specify the motion trajectory using a sketch, which
                    is
                    provided as a query.
                <p>However there are multiple problems associated with this paradigm. Firstly, different users sketch
                    the
                    same query differently according to their own perception of reality. Secondly, sketches are sparse
                    and
                    abstract representations of images and the two modalities can not be compared directly. Thirdly,
                    compared to images, datasets of sketches are rare. It is very difficult, if not impossible to train
                    a
                    system with sketches of every possible category. The features should be robust enough to retrieve
                    classes that were not a part of training.
                <p>In this thesis, the work can be broadly divided into three parts. First, we develop a
                    motion-trajectory
                    based video retrieval strategy and propose a representation for sketches that aims to reduce the
                    perceptual variability among different users. We also propose a novel retrieval strategy, which
                    combines
                    multiple feature representations for a final result using a cumulative scoring mechanism.
                <p>In order to tackle the problem of multiple modalities, we propose a sketch-based image retrieval
                    strategy
                    by mapping the two modalities into a lower dimensional sub-space where they are maximally
                    correlated. We
                    use Cluster Canonical Correlation Analysis (c-CCA), a modified version of standard CCA, for the
                    mapping.
                <p>Finally, we investigate the use of semantic features derived from a Convolutional Neural Network, and
                    extend the idea of sketch-based image retrieval to the task of zero-shot learning or unknown class
                    retrieval. We define an objective function for the network such that, while training, a close miss
                    is
                    penalized less than a distant miss. Our training encodes semantic similarity among the different
                    classes. We perform experiments to evaluate our algorithms on well known datasets and our results
                    show
                    that our features perform reasonably well in challenging scenarios.</p>
